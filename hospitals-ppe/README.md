# hospital.community

Amidst COVID-19 our hospitals and the people who staff them face unbelievable pressure. Equipments such as masks and gowns are in short supply and healthcare workers need people to shop for them and provide healthcare.

Currently, both the needs and availability of these items and services are spread across thousands of disparate spreadsheets and Facebook Groups.

This project aims to collect and map this data to hospitals and geographies. As we progress, it can faciliate the actual exchange of goods and services.

## Initial Milestones

# Milestone 1: Index to Existing Docs & Groups

In this milestone, users can submit links to existing asks and needs from a particular hospital. To prevent abuse, edits are approved (quickly) by moderators.

# Milestone 2: A database of goods and services

In this milestone, healthcare workers can request goods or services and the public can pro-offer services. Healthcare workers are verified through a photo of their badge or e-mail address.

# Milestone 3: Bringing supply to demand.

In this milestone, we begin to coordinate the exchange of goods or services across hospital boundaries. If a hospital is in particularly bad shape, we can surface this information and invite other not immediately nearby to help.

## Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome. We maintain the following principles for contributors:

### Keep it Simple.
- We need to build a codebase that is highly predictable and quickly modifiable.
- We'd rather have Craigslist in 1 day than Airbnb in 10.
- Only static web pages and APIs.
- We are extremely reluctant to adopt new dependencies.

### This isn't about us.
- We don't want people to use this if it isn't useful.
- We need to be extremely mindful of the cognitive cost of using this and ensure that it is less than the benefit.

### Minimize personal data
- Only need information to validate a user is (or isn't) a healthcare worker.
- Rely on publicly available datasets to cross-check authenticity.
- No passwords needed, just use email and text links to log people in.
